For those who are curious about what CrackShot is capable of achieving, but squealed like a little girl upon viewing the complete list of modules, you're in luck. The plugin comes with 18 default weapons, so you can jump right into the action! ... a very small taste of the action.
 
necesitaria que el plugin se actualizara a versiones mas recientes, aunque tome tiempo, ya que la lista de playsound y id item no estan actualizadas y cambio el sistema de ID's, por lo que perjudica si se utiliza un texture pack con id's nuevas

Hello, I ran into a problem. My texture of the weapon will only work if I call it RTT so when I write in the name of the pridmet, the crackshot also does not take this texture if it is the first one and then I do everything works as well but it does not shoot
 
It wont let me use anything unless op. it say dont have permission, yet when i op then type /crackshot.use.all it just says unknown command, what is the exact and full command i have to write to enable all joining players to use it? thanks
 
So whenever I run /shot list all Command only a few weapons show up and all the weapons that are full auto or pistols or shotguns etc aren't showing up, I checked the default weapons.yml and all of the weapons are there but they don't show up in the list, whenever I run /shot config reload it says "default weapon.yml is configured incorrectly" but I did not mess with the files whatsoever, any solution to this? The plugin works perfectly for other servers
 
Just tried to do the Deputy Crackshot skill challenge and even if you hold the power until the bar is full you can see the cannonball explode almost immediately, on the further back cannons it explodes half way between the cannon barrel exit and the wall on full power.
 
Deputy crackshots cannons in Stormbluff Isle are currently bugged to have no arch and explode upon firing at even max power infront of the cannon. so it makes it impossible to get world completion due to this skill challenge being bugged out. and leaving people frustrated or trying to do this event for over an hour trying to find a way past it.

The **Crackshot**, sometimes known as the **CS,** or the **Sniper**, is a weapon class that has a sniper rifle with one bullet in the chamber and 20 additional ammunitions. Bullets from the crackshot can often kill opponents in one shot; it is only non-fatal if the bullet misses the center area of the egg and hits the edge, dealing up to 60 damage. This can also happen when lag happens (both client and server-side). If the bullet hits the center of the egg it will be a one-shot kill unless a blank occurs. If your opponent has the hard-boiled power-up, you will have to hit the dead center or else the other person will only be damaged because they have x2 the health. This is perhaps the most commonly used gun in the whole game, along with the Scrambler. Each bullet carton picked up off the ground supplies 4 bullets. The Crackshot is an excellent weapon for short, medium, or long range targets, as it can kill an opponent with 1 shot. There are currently **61** Crackshots.
 
The **Crackshot** is a multi-purpose weapon, and probably the most versatile weapon in the game, so it is also a popular weapon with ground dwellers, who can use it to one-shot enemies in alleys, tunnels, structures, corners, and trees. It works just fine in close-range. It has an advantage over the Whipper and EggK-47 (especially at long range), as even if users of those weapons trail you, you can quickly turn around and one-shot them. Also, if you are having trouble shaking off an opponent or have low health, you can climb up to the top of a ladder and guard the ladder while dropping a grenade. It is also popular in competitive Shell Shockers leagues and hosted events, with most teams having at least two **Crackshot** users. The **Crackshot** has a big percentage of hitting one shot. It's mostly the reason why in Shell Shockers montages or trickshots, the player will use a **Crackshot**. Weapon skins don't alter a player's performance in any way.
 
Crackshot is an ability exclusive to Prompto usable in *Final Fantasy XV: Episode Prompto* and through character swapping in the main game. It is a ranged attack that triggers when an enemy is in a vulnerable state. Up to three crackshots can be performed on one enemy, and defeating enemies this way gives AP. Crackshots also increase the Finesse grade in battle.
 
Crackshot is an ability activated after using Trigger Happy or the upgraded version of Prompto's Limit Burst (which shares the same ability name). It is a single hit attack that costs 72 MP with a 7x damage modifier, targets one enemy and ignores DEF by 50%.
